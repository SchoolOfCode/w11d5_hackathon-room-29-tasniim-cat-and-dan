/* 
School of Code Final Grade

--> INSTRUCTIONS
Create a function called SOCfinalGrade, which calculates the final grade of a student depending on two parameters: a grade for the final project and the number of completed daily tests.

This function should take two arguments: project- grade for project (from 0 to 100); daily tests - number of completed tests (from 0 to 48);

This function should return a string (final grade). There are four types of final grades:

- If project score is over 90 and the number of daily tests completed is 40 or over, then give them the final grade "A - You're getting hired "

- If project score is between 80-89 and the number of daily tests completed is 30-39, then give them the final grade "B - You're doing well "

- If project score is between 60-79 and the number of daily tests completed is 20-29, then give them the final grade of "C - Come to code camp"

- If project score is less than 60 and the number of daily tests completed is less than 20, then give them the final grade "F - Do your recap tasks again"

Examples(Inputs-->Output):

100, 42 --> "A - You're getting hired "
65, 25 --> "C - Come to code camp"

function SOCfinalGrade(project, dailytests) {
  return; // final grade
