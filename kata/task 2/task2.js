// You have been assigned to create usernames for the people in your company
// The format the company uses is:
// -- First initial of first name
// -- Surname
// -- Age
// For Example, Dan Martin who is 23, will have the username : dMARTIN23
// The function takes in three parameters: firstname, lastname and age and should create the username based on these paramaters.

// If it is a double barrell name it keeps in the dash.
// For example, Kazeem George-Ryan who is 45, will have the username : kGEORGE-RYAN45

// PLEASE NOTE, USERNAMES ARE CASE SENSITIVE

//ðŸ‘‰ Write the function your CodeWarriors will start with below here:

export function createUsername(firstname, surname, age) {}
