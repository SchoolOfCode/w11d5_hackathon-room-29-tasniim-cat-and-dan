# This is a challenge to help you improve your knowledge of React testing. 

## Instructions:

You have just been hired as a junior developer in your new company, and your line manager
has tasked you with checking that the function of the buttons is working, and that they have the correct text. 
Each button is in its own component, in the component folder.

During the process, you accidentally delete some information from all three of the components.

Please add to the components' logic, so that all three of the tests pass.

 * Run tests using 'Npm run test'.
