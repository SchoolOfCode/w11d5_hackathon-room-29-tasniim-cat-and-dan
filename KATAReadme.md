# This is a challenge to help you improve your knowledge of React testing.

## Instructions:

## Task 1

You have just joined a new company as a junior developer. Your manager has asked yiou to look at the tests in the kata folder and create a function so that the tests pass.

1. cd into the kata folder
2. Create functions in the task1.js and task2.js files so the tests pass
3. npm run test

## Task 2

Your line manager is happy with your work from task 1 and 2. You have been trusted to check the newly created button components in src/components.
Each button is in its own component, in the component folder.
You will see the tests have already been created, and we're all passing earlier, however, you just accidentally deleted some of the logic in each component.

1. cd into the main folder to access the react app
2. check each button component has the correct text and logic so the tests pass again.
3. npm run test

Good luck!
